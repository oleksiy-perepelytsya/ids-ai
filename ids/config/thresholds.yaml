# CROSS Consensus Thresholds
# These are tunable based on learning data
# Start strict and adjust as system learns

consensus:
  # Confidence thresholds by round
  # Higher = more confident agents must be
  confidence_threshold:
    round_1: 85.0  # Very strict initially
    round_2: 75.0  # Moderate after debate
    round_3: 70.0  # More lenient before user feedback
  
  # Maximum acceptable risk by round
  # Lower = more risk-averse
  max_acceptable_risk:
    round_1: 20.0  # Very cautious initially
    round_2: 30.0  # Moderate risk acceptable
    round_3: 40.0  # Higher risk ok if needed
  
  # Minimum expected outcome by round
  # Higher = expecting better results
  min_outcome_score:
    round_1: 80.0  # Expect excellent outcome
    round_2: 70.0  # Good outcome acceptable
    round_3: 60.0  # Decent outcome ok
  
  # Agreement thresholds (standard deviation)
  # Lower = agents must agree more closely
  max_confidence_std: 15.0  # Max divergence in confidence
  max_outcome_std: 15.0     # Max divergence in expected outcome

# Dead-end detection patterns
dead_end:
  # Confidence decreasing threshold
  confidence_decline_threshold: 10.0  # If confidence drops >10% between rounds
  
  # Circular debate detection
  similarity_threshold: 0.85  # If rounds are >85% similar, likely circular
  
  # Persistent risk threshold
  persistent_risk_rounds: 2  # Same high risk for N rounds = dead-end
